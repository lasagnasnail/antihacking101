var phrase  = "<h1>Anti-Hacking 101</h1><br>By: Briana Huynh and Jocelyn Martinez <br> <p>Companies, such as Instagram and Facebook, use encryption, hashing, and salt to protect your passwords.cAlthough these three methods all provide security, thatâ€™s where the differences end. Encryption is meant to be decoded, a two-way function, while hashing is a one way function.</p><br> Salting is an additional part towards hashing, and changes the hash value produced. <br> Encryption is the process of taking information and changing it into a code; a system of scrambled data that can be unscrambled. Meanwhile, hashes are added symbols that further encrypt data. <br> Some examples of hashes are SHA1 and MD. <br> Tips for a strong password: Have passwords that consist of the same style but are specific for each site <br>(for example, use Enter4Y2hoo for yahoo, and Enter4Gm2il for gmail) Experiment with your keyboard, and use emoticons if allowed! <br>The longer your password is, the harder it is to decrypt!";
